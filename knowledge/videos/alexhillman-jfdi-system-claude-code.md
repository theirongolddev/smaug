Alex Hillman discusses his journey from not writing code in 15 years to building the JFDI system using Claude Code. The video covers technical decisions made during the development process, ethical boundaries when working with AI assistants, and insights from AI-assisted software development.

## Key Takeaways

- Returning to coding after extended absence is viable with modern AI tools like Claude Code
- JFDI system represents a practical approach to building with AI assistance
- Technical architecture decisions are critical when integrating AI-generated code
- Ethical considerations around AI coding require deliberate boundaries and choices
- The experience bridges the gap between "traditional coding" and "AI-assisted development"
- Workflow optimization becomes as important as technical implementation
