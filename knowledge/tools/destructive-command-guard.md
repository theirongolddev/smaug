A high-performance Rust hook that intercepts and blocks destructive commands before AI coding agents can execute them. dcg (Destructive Command Guard) protects against catastrophic commands like `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, and database operations that could destroy uncommitted work. Designed specifically for use with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other AI coding agents.

## Key Features
- Zero-config protection blocking 49+ dangerous patterns out of the box
- Sub-millisecond latency with SIMD-accelerated filtering
- Heredoc and inline script scanning to catch embedded destructive commands
- Smart context detection (won't block `grep "rm -rf"` but will block execution)
- 49+ modular security packs for databases, Kubernetes, Docker, cloud platforms, Terraform
- Agent-specific trust levels and profiles
- Scan mode for CI/CD integration and pre-commit hooks
- Fail-open design ensures it never blocks legitimate workflow due to timeouts
- `dcg explain` command shows exactly why commands are blocked
- Supports Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Aider, Continue, and Codex

## TL;DR

**The Problem**: AI coding agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) occasionally run catastrophic commands like `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf ./src`, or `DROP TABLE users`—destroying hours of uncommitted work in seconds.

**The Solution**: dcg is a high-performance hook that intercepts destructive commands *before* they execute, blocking them with clear explanations and safer alternatives.

### Why Use dcg?

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Zero-Config Protection** | Blocks dangerous git/filesystem commands out of the box |
| **49+ Security Packs** | Databases, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure, Terraform, and more |
| **Sub-Millisecond Latency** | SIMD-accelerated filtering—you won't notice it's there |
| **Heredoc/Inline Script Scanning** | Catches `python -c "os.remove(...)"` and embedded shell scripts |
| **Smart Context Detection** | Won't block `grep "rm -rf"` (data) but will block `rm -rf /` (execution) |
| **Scan Mode for CI** | Pre-commit hooks and CI integration to catch dangerous commands in code review |
| **Fail-Open Design** | Never blocks your workflow due to timeouts or parse errors |
| **Explain Mode** | `dcg explain "command"` shows exactly why something is blocked |

### Quick Example

```bash
# AI agent tries to run:
$ git reset --hard HEAD~5

# dcg intercepts and blocks:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BLOCKED  dcg
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Reason:  git reset --hard destroys uncommitted changes

Command: git reset --hard HEAD~5

Tip: Consider using 'git stash' first to save your changes.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Enable More Protection

```toml
# ~/.config/dcg/config.toml
[packs]
enabled = [
    "database.postgresql",    # Blocks DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE
    "kubernetes.kubectl",     # Blocks kubectl delete namespace
    "cloud.aws",              # Blocks aws ec2 terminate-instances
    "containers.docker",      # Blocks docker system prune
]
```

### Agent-Specific Profiles

dcg automatically detects which AI coding agent is invoking it and can apply
agent-specific trust levels:

```toml
# Trust Claude Code more
[agents.claude-code]
trust_level = "high"
additional_allowlist = ["npm run build"]

# Restrict unknown agents
[agents.unknown]
trust_level = "low"
extra_packs = ["paranoid"]
```

See [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) for full documentation on supported agents
and configuration options.

## Origins & Authors

This project began as a Python script by Jeffrey Emanuel, who recognized that AI coding agents, while incredibly useful, occasionally run catastrophic commands that destroy hours of uncommitted work. The original implementation was a simple but effective hook that intercepted dangerous git and filesystem commands before execution.

- **[Jeffrey Emanuel](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone)** - Original concept and Python implementation ([source](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/misc_coding_agent_tips_and_scripts/blob/main/DESTRUCTIVE_GIT_COMMAND_CLAUDE_HOOKS_SETUP.md)); substantially expanded the Rust version with the modular pack system (49+ security packs), heredoc/inline-script scanning, the three-tier architecture, context classification, allowlists, scan mode, and the dual regex engine
- **[Darin Gordon](https://github.com/Dowwie)** - Initial Rust port with performance optimizations
