Alkalye is a beautiful, privacy-first markdown editor with end-to-end encryption, real-time collaboration, and presentation capabilities. Built on Jazz (local-first sync framework), it provides offline-first functionality as a PWA, presentation mode for slideshows, teleprompter mode with auto-scrolling, and encrypted image assets. The tech stack combines Jazz for sync/encryption with React 19, TanStack Router, Vite 7, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and CodeMirror 6 for the editor.
