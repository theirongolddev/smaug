# Phage Explorer

Interactive bioinformatics tool for visualizing and analyzing bacteriophage genomes.

## What It Does

- Visualize bacteriophage DNA sequences with color coding
- Analyze amino acid sequences
- View 3D protein structures from RCSB PDB
- 40+ analysis visualizations
- 23 analysis algorithms
- Data on 24 different phage classes
- Virtual gel electrophoresis simulation
- Restriction enzyme digestion simulation

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript/React
- **3D Structures:** WebGL
- **Backend:** Rust/WebAssembly for performance
- **Data:** ~150k lines of code

## Key Features

- Works offline
- Mobile-friendly (desktop recommended for full experience)
- Complete genetic data and 3D structures
- Educational focus - designed for teaching bacteriophage biology
- Free and open source

## Why It Matters

Described as "the most complete informational/educational software about phages available anywhere." Bridges the gap between academic molecular biology and interactive visualization, making complex genetic and structural data tangible and explorable.

Built as a deep-dive exploration tool for understanding phage biology - from genetic code to physical structure to protein folding.
