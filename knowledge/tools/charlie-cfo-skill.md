## Summary

A Claude Code skill named after Charlie Munger that provides financial frameworks specifically for bootstrapped, high-growth startups. Charlie automates financial decision-making by integrating with financial sources (Mercury, Stripe, ChartMogul, Ramp, Google Sheets) to provide real-time analysis on cash management, unit economics, capital allocation, and forecasting. Enables founders to understand runway, make hiring ROI decisions, and track key metrics without manual spreadsheet work.

## Key Takeaways

- **Capital discipline as competitive advantage**: Philosophy aligned with Munger's principle that constraint-driven decision-making outperforms unlimited spending
- **Five financial domains**: Cash management, unit economics, capital allocation, working capital, and forecasting
- **Runway-focused targets**: Recommends 24-36 month minimum runway as survival metric
- **Financial integration**: Connects directly to banking (Mercury), payments (Stripe), analytics (ChartMogul), and expense management (Ramp)
- **Quick payback requirement**: Every investment needs less than 12-month payback period
- **LTV:CAC optimization**: Unit economics become survival requirements, not nice-to-haves
- **Metric benchmarks included**: References include formulas, industry benchmarks, and case studies from successful bootstrapped companies (Mailchimp, Zapier, Basecamp, ConvertKit, Zoho)
- **AI-driven analysis**: Claude Code skill automatically activates for financial questions, removing friction from complex calculations
- **Open source**: MIT licensed and available via npm

# Charlie CFO Skill

A Claude Code skill for bootstrapped CFO financial management.

Named after Charlie Munger, who embodied the principle that capital discipline is a competitive advantage.

## What It Does

Charlie provides financial frameworks for bootstrapped, high-growth startups:

- **Cash management** — Runway calculations, reserve structures, burn analysis
- **Unit economics** — LTV:CAC ratios, CAC payback, gross margin targets
- **Capital allocation** — Hiring ROI, Rule of 40, investment payback periods
- **Working capital** — Cash conversion cycle, AR/AP optimization, prepay strategies
- **Forecasting** — Driver-based planning, scenario modeling, 13-week cash flow

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add EveryInc/charlie-cfo-skill
```

## Usage

Once installed, Charlie activates automatically when you ask financial questions:

- "Should we make this hire?"
- "How much runway do we need?"
- "What metrics should I track?"
- "How do I forecast revenue?"
- "What's a healthy LTV:CAC ratio?"

## Philosophy

**Profit is a constraint, not a goal.** Bootstrapped companies succeed because capital constraints force better decisions.

Key principles:
- Unit economics are survival requirements, not nice-to-haves
- Revenue per employee matters more than headcount
- Runway targets: 24-36 months minimum
- Every investment needs a <12 month payback period

## References

The skill includes detailed reference docs:

- `references/metrics-benchmarks.md` — Formulas and industry benchmarks
- `references/case-studies.md` — Examples from Mailchimp, Zapier, Basecamp, ConvertKit, Zoho
