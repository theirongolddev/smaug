Google Workspace CLI (`gws`) — one command-line tool for all of Google Workspace: Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Chat, Admin, and more. Built dynamically from Google's Discovery Service at runtime, so it picks up new API endpoints automatically without code changes. Designed for both humans (--help, --dry-run, auto-pagination) and AI agents (structured JSON output + 40+ bundled agent skills). Written in Rust, distributed via npm. Not an officially supported Google product.

## Key Features
- Dynamic command surface built at runtime from Google Discovery Service — auto-updates as APIs change
- 40+ bundled agent skills for LLM integration out of the box
- Structured JSON output on all responses; NDJSON streaming with --page-all
- AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage with OS keyring integration
- Multiple auth workflows: interactive OAuth, service account, pre-obtained token, env var
- --dry-run flag previews requests before execution
- Gemini CLI extension and Nix flake available

`gws` doesn't ship a static list of commands. It reads Google's own [Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery) at runtime and builds its entire command surface dynamically. When Google Workspace adds an API endpoint or method, `gws` picks it up automatically.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — for `npm install` (or download a pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/releases))
- **A Google Cloud project** — required for OAuth credentials. You can create one via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or with the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) or with the `gws auth setup` command.
- **A Google account** with access to Google Workspace

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli
```

> The npm package bundles pre-built native binaries for your OS and architecture.
> No Rust toolchain required.

Pre-built binaries are also available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/releases) page.

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli --locked
```

A Nix flake is also available at `github:googleworkspace/cli`

```bash
nix run github:googleworkspace/cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
gws auth setup     # walks you through Google Cloud project config
gws auth login     # subsequent OAuth login
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 5}'
```

## Why gws?

**For humans** — stop writing `curl` calls against REST docs. `gws` gives you `--help` on every resource, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and auto‑pagination.

**For AI agents** — every response is structured JSON. Pair it with the included agent skills and your LLM can manage Workspace without custom tooling.

```bash
# List the 10 most recent files
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 10}'

# Create a spreadsheet
gws sheets spreadsheets create --json '{"properties": {"title": "Q1 Budget"}}'

# Send a Chat message
gws chat spaces messages create \
  --params '{"parent": "spaces/xyz"}' \
  --json '{"text": "Deploy complete."}' \
  --dry-run

# Introspect any method's request/response schema
gws schema drive.files.list

# Stream paginated results as NDJSON
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 100}' --page-all | jq -r '.files[].name'
```

## Authentication

The CLI supports multiple auth workflows so it works on your laptop, in CI, and on a server.

### Which setup should I use?

| I have… | Use |
|---|---|
| `gcloud` installed and authenticated | [`gws auth setup`](#interactive-local-desktop) (fastest) |
| A GCP project but no `gcloud` | [Manual OAuth setup](#manual-oauth-setup-google-cloud-console) |
| An existing OAuth access token | [`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN`](#pre-obtained-access-token) |
| Existing Credentials | [`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE`](#service-account-server-to-server) |

### Interactive (local desktop)

Credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) with the key stored in your OS keyring.

```bash
gws auth setup       # one-time: creates a Cloud project, enables APIs, logs you in
gws auth login       # subsequent scope selection and login
```

> `gws auth setup` requires the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). If you don't have `gcloud`, use the [manual
