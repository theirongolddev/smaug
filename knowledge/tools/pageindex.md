Open-source library that provides vector database-free RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by using hierarchical document tree structures instead of embeddings.

## Key Features

- **No embeddings required** - Uses document structure instead of vector similarity
- **No chunking needed** - Processes documents hierarchically
- **98.7% accuracy** on FinanceBench financial benchmarks
- **Structural reasoning** - Lets LLMs reason over document organization rather than keyword matching
- **100% open source** - Fully transparent and customizable
- Significantly simpler architecture than traditional vector DBs

## Why It Matters

Eliminates the embedding-chunking bottleneck in RAG systems by treating document structure as the primary signal. Achieves strong performance on financial analysis tasks while being fundamentally simpler to implement and maintain.
