A distributed, git-backed issue tracking system designed specifically for AI agents. Beads (bd) provides persistent, structured memory for coding agents by replacing messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph that allows agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context. It's built with multi-agent coordination in mind, featuring hash-based IDs to prevent merge collisions, JSON output for agent compatibility, and advanced features like semantic memory decay and agent-optimized task detection.

## Key Takeaways
- Designed for AI agents to maintain structured task memory across long development sessions
- Git as database: issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/` directory, versioned like code
- Agent-optimized with JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection
- Hash-based IDs prevent merge collisions in multi-agent and multi-branch workflows
- Supports hierarchical task organization (epics, tasks, sub-tasks) for complex projects
- Built-in messaging with threading, graph links (relates_to, duplicates, supersedes), and memory decay

Beads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don't clone this repo into your project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in YOUR project
cd your-project
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo "Use 'bd' for task tracking" >> AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don't need to clone this repository into your project.

## 🛠 Features

* **Git as Database:** Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`. Versioned, branched, and merged like code.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Invisible Infrastructure:** SQLite local cache for speed; background daemon for auto-sync.
* **Compaction:** Semantic "memory decay" summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.
* **Messaging:** Message issue type with threading (`--thread`), ephemeral lifecycle, and mail delegation.
* **Graph Links:** `relates_to`, `duplicates`, `supersedes`, and `replies_to` for knowledge graphs.

## 📖 Essential Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create "Title" -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd update <id> --claim` | Atomically claim a task (sets assignee + in_progress). |
| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show <id>` | View task details and audit trail. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy & Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects.

**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:

* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.
* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.

## 📦 Installation

* **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`
* **Homebrew:** `brew install beads`
* **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`

**Requirements:** Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, or Windows.
