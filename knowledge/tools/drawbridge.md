Drawbridge is a Claude Code skill that integrates with Excalidraw to enable natural language diagram creation. Instead of struggling to manually create flowcharts and architecture diagrams, you can describe what you want and Claude Code will render it in real-time on an Excalidraw canvas.

## Key Features

- Real-time diagram rendering in Excalidraw
- Natural language interface - just describe the diagram
- Claude Code skill integration for seamless workflow
- Support for flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and dependency maps
- Open source and extensible

## Why It's Useful

Perfect for users who find visual diagram tools intuitive but struggle with the manual drawing process. By combining Claude's understanding of your intent with Excalidraw's visualization capabilities, you can quickly prototype and iterate on diagrams.
