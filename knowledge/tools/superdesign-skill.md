SuperDesign is an AI Designer skill for coding agents that solves the problem of exploring UI variations. It understands your existing codebase, reproduces the current UI pixel-perfect, and generates multiple production-ready design variations on an infinite browser canvas.

## Key Features

- Codebase-aware UI design generation
- Pixel-perfect reproduction of existing designs
- Multiple production-ready design variations
- Infinite canvas browser interface for exploration
- Seamless integration with coding agents

## Why Bookmarked

Addresses a critical pain point for "vibe coders" who need to quickly iterate on UI designs without losing the ability to switch between variations. The codebase awareness means generated designs stay consistent with the existing implementation.
