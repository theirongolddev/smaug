A Claude Code / Codex skill that reverse engineers comprehensive product and technical specifications directly from git branch implementations. Instead of documenting code after it's written, schematic systematically analyzes changed files to produce structured specifications covering problem statement, product requirements, architecture, technical design, file inventories, testing strategy, rollout plan, and risks. Useful for documenting in-progress branches, onboarding, and creating PR descriptions retroactively.

## Key Takeaways

- Automates specification writing by analyzing implementation rather than requiring separate documentation efforts
- Uses parallel agent processing to efficiently explore large changesets across multiple file groups
- Produces comprehensive 11-section markdown documents that serve as both documentation and architectural reference
- Works bidirectionally: helps document existing work AND helps understand what a branch actually does at the product level

## README

# schematic

A skill that reverse engineers a detailed product and technical specification from a git branch's implementation.

Use it when:
- A branch has shipped or is in-progress and needs documentation
- You need to understand what a branch does at product and architecture level
- Onboarding to someone else's feature branch
- Creating PR descriptions or design docs after the fact

Produces a structured markdown spec covering problem statement, product requirements, architecture, technical design, file inventories, testing strategy, rollout plan, and risks.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blader/schematic.git ~/.claude/skills/schematic
```

Restart Claude Code to pick up the new skill.

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blader/schematic.git ~/.codex/skills/schematic
```

Or use the built-in skill installer:

```
Install the skill from github.com/blader/schematic
```

Restart Codex to pick up the new skill.

## Usage

In Claude Code or Codex, just ask:

- "Reverse engineer a spec from this branch"
- "Analyze this branch"
- "Write a spec from the code"
- "Document what this branch does"

The skill will systematically analyze every file changed on the branch and produce a comprehensive specification document.

## How it works

1. **Scope the branch** - Gets the full diff stats and categorizes files
2. **Parallel deep exploration** - Launches 2-4 parallel agents to read file groups concurrently
3. **Cross-check for gaps** - Diffs analyzed files against the full file list to catch stragglers
4. **Write the spec** - Produces a structured 11-section markdown document
5. **Verify completeness** - Ensures every changed file is accounted for
