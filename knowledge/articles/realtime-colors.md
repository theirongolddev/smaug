                        plan. No kidding."      FAQ Answers to some questions you might have.    
How many colors should I choose?
     
Normally, 3 colors are absolutely fine (meaning background, text, and one accent
                            color).However, if you want, you can have more. Usually, we don’t add more than 6 colors
                            across a platform. It would just make things too... complicated. Plus, it makes it hard to
                            keep
                            the colors consistent throughout the design.
   
How does the contrast checker work?
      
The contrast checker shows the contrast ratio between the selected color and its
                            background/foreground.The contrast checker has 3 lights:  x / Red: The contrast ratio does not pass either AAA or AA. Therefore, both large and
                                normal texts are hardly readable. - / Yellow: The contrast ratio might pass AA but won't pass AAA. Large texts might be
                                readable but normal texts are probably not readable. ✓ / Green: The contrast ratio passes both AA and AAA. Both large and normal texts are
                                readable.  Learn more about the contrast
                                checker.
    
What does the hero image represent?
     
The hero image is inspired by Piet Mondrian's Composition with Large Red Plane, Yellow,
                                Black,
                                Grey and Blue. This composition keeps the ratio of the main colors (red, blue, and
                            yellow) very close to the 60-30-10 rule of UI design. This is mainly why I've chosen this
                            composition to visualize the distribution of the colors on the page.
   
How can I set up the fonts?
     
You can enter the name of a font from Google Fonts or the fonts installed on your
                            device. Read more about Font
                                Setup.
   
Can I use the generated colors commercially?
     
Yes! You can use the colors you generate here however you'd like, commercially or non-commercially (I don't own the colors/fonts). The license only applies to the source code and materials specific to this website.
