# What is Your Superpower?

Obie Fernandez's reflection on identifying personal superpowers in the age of AI, structured around his experience as CTO of ZAR and the shift toward "product engineers" rather than traditional roles.

## The Core Question

**What is your superpower?** Not "what are you good at?" Not "what do you enjoy?" Rather: what makes you irreplaceably valuable? What changes the game when you walk into a room?

## The Product Engineer Era

At ZAR, engineering has evolved toward an "AI-forward" model centered on **product engineers**—individuals who combine:

- Entrepreneurial thinking
- Scientific methodology
- Deep technical skill
- Ability to form and defend opinions about what to build
- Openness to changing positions based on data

Key difference from traditional roles: product engineers identify problems, form hypotheses, ship experiments, and measure results without waiting for specs.

## Evaluation Criteria

When interviewing candidates, focus on:

- Can they think critically?
- Can they form opinions about product direction?
- Can they defend those opinions?
- Can they change their mind when data contradicts their assumptions?

## Obie's Superpower: Audacity

**Audacity** = willingness to look people in the eye, state radically different futures enabled by technology, get them to act accordingly, and provide frameworks/tools for success.

Examples:
- 2005 at ThoughtWorks: Shifted top talent from Java/.NET to Ruby on Rails before it was obvious
  - Became first of hundreds of worldwide consultants to bill Ruby work (John Deere)
  - Grew from 0% to 40% of billable work in two years
- Current: Flattening engineering titles, eliminating roadmaps, killing ceremony and backlogs
  - Bet on relentless daily experimentation over planning
  - Success depends on A+ players; would fail with B players

## How to Find Your Answer

1. **Look for patterns in wins**: How did you accomplish victories? Speed? Vision? Translation between groups?

2. **Ask what people bring to you**: Not your job title, but what challenges actually land on your desk when things break or get stuck

3. **Consider what you'd do for free**: The thing you can't stop doing

4. **Compare to AI agents**: The hard truth of 2026: if an AI can do what you do 80% as well, it's not a superpower anymore
   - Your superpower must be what AI *amplifies*, not replaces
   - Judgment, taste, relationships, intuition born from experience

## The Uncomfortable Follow-Up

Use AI (like Claude) to challenge yourself through dialogue—keep asking "why?" and "what do you mean?" until you've articulated something genuinely valuable.

## Bottom Line

Human talent thriving in 2026+ will be those who know exactly what superpower they bring. They pitch on specific, demonstrable, hard-to-replicate value—not generic competence.

## Applicable To

- Career strategists
- CTOs and engineering leaders
- Anyone working alongside AI tools
- Product-oriented engineers
- Career transitioners
