# Bromelain for Gut Health - Comprehensive Research Review

**Note:** Amanda from work recommended researching bromelain (also spelled "bromaline") for gut health. This document compiles current scientific evidence, particularly relevant to ulcerative colitis.

## Executive Summary

Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme complex derived from pineapple with significant promise for digestive health and inflammatory bowel conditions. Key findings:

- **Proven anti-inflammatory effects** in both animal models and human trials
- **Specific benefit for ulcerative colitis** shown in randomized controlled trials
- **Generally safe** with minimal side effects at therapeutic doses
- **Important drug interactions** with blood thinners and antibiotics
- **Requires medical consultation** before use, especially with existing medications

---

## What is Bromelain?

**Bromelain** (commonly misspelled as "bromaline") is a complex mixture of proteolytic (protein-digesting) enzymes derived from the pineapple plant (*Ananas comosus*). It is extracted from:
- Pineapple stem (primary commercial source)
- Pineapple fruit
- Pineapple juice

Bromelain is manufactured primarily in Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, and Puerto Rico and is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

---

## Mechanisms of Action for Gut Health

### 1. Protein Digestion Enhancement

Bromelain's proteolytic activity helps break down proteins into peptides and amino acids, supporting:
- Improved protein digestion
- Enhanced nutrient absorption
- Favorable environment for enzymatic activity
- Overall increased digestive capacity

The enzyme may indirectly support the production and secretion of other digestive enzymes by stimulating pancreatic and intestinal function.

### 2. Anti-Inflammatory Properties

Bromelain exhibits powerful anti-inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms:

- **Reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines:** Decreases secretion of:
  - G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)
  - GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)
  - IFN-γ (Interferon gamma)
  - TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor)
  - CCL4/MIP-1β (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein)

- **Inhibits TNF-α receptors** on intestinal epithelial cells
- **Modulates immune response** in inflamed gut tissue
- **Survives gastrointestinal transit** while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity

### 3. Gut Microbiota Balance

Preliminary research suggests bromelain may support maintenance of healthy gut microbiota balance, though this mechanism requires further investigation.

## Evidence for Ulcerative Colitis

### Human Clinical Trials

#### Randomized Controlled Trial (2025)

A **triple-blind, placebo-controlled study** published in *Scientific Reports* (2025) investigated bromelain supplementation in ulcerative colitis patients:

- **Participants:** 70 individuals with mild-to-moderate UC
- **Treatment:** 400 mg bromelain daily vs. maltodextrin placebo
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Results:** Bromelain supplementation reduced disease activity and improved quality of life in UC patients

**Conclusion:** "In UC patients, the severity of the disease is reduced by bromelain supplementation, which is an alternative therapy."

#### Case Reports

Early anecdotal evidence from the *Annals of Internal Medicine* reported that orally administered bromelain induced **clinical and endoscopic remission** in two UC patients whose disease was refractory to conventional multi-agent therapy.

**Source:** [Annals of Internal Medicine - Use of Bromelain for Mild UC](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-132-8-200004180-00026)

### Animal Model Studies

Multiple studies in the **IL-10-deficient mouse model** (standard UC animal model) showed:

- **Dose-dependent effect:** Daily oral bromelain at 2-20 mg/kg substantially reduced colitis incidence and severity
- **Preventive benefit:** Beginning treatment at 5 weeks of age decreased spontaneous colitis development
- **Therapeutic benefit:** Bromelain reduced clinical and histologic inflammation severity in mice with established colitis

### In Vitro Studies

Laboratory studies using colon biopsies from IBD patients demonstrated:
- Decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF, CCL4)
- Reduced expression of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Maintained anti-inflammatory activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion

## Gaps in Current Research

While evidence is promising, researchers note:

1. **Limited large-scale human trials** - Most UC research relies on small samples or animal models
2. **Mechanism details unclear** - Specific molecular pathways need elucidation
3. **Optimal dosing protocols** - UC-specific dosing regimens require further study
4. **Long-term safety** - Extended use (>8 weeks) not well-documented in IBD populations
5. **Combination therapy** - Interactions with standard UC medications need investigation

**Quote from research:** "Despite promising outcomes in trials and prior experimental evidence, the clinical application of bromelain as a complementary treatment for ulcerative colitis remains underexplored, as most previous investigations have focused on animal models or in vitro settings, leaving a notable gap in the clinical literature."
