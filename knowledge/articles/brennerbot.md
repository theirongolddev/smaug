What's InsideA research toolkit for applying Brenner's epistemology to your own scientific questions.Core WorkflowFrom Question to Conclusion: The Brenner LoopResearch sessions follow a rigorous, reproducible path. Every step is tracked, auditable, and reversible.Undo / RedoEvery action is reversible. Explore without fear.Session ReplayReproduce any session exactly for audit and learning.Error RecoveryGraceful checkpoints when things go wrong.Multi-Agent OrchestrationYour Research Team: AI Agents That Debate, Challenge, and SynthesizeEach agent has a precise mandate. Together they sharpen hypotheses, design lethal tests, and merge evidence into auditable artifacts - without surrendering control."What if you could have Claude, GPT, and Gemini debate your hypothesis - challenging each other until only the strongest ideas survive?"Oxford StyleDebate ModeProposition vs opposition with a judgeBest for: Testing hypothesis strengthSocraticDebate ModeProbing questions to surface hidden assumptionsBest for: Finding weak links fastSteelman ContestDebate ModeBuild the strongest case, then dismantle itBest for: Exploring the hypothesis spaceTerminalbrenner-cli# Start a debate session
