Textream is a free, open-source macOS teleprompter app designed for content creators, streamers, presenters, and podcasters. It offers three primary guidance modes: real-time word tracking (using on-device speech recognition), classic auto-scroll (at adjustable speeds), and voice-activated scrolling (which automatically pauses when the speaker goes silent). The app features an elegant Dynamic Island overlay that displays your script with live word highlighting as you speak, keeping the audience unaware while maintaining your visibility. It includes accessibility-first design with dyslexia-friendly fonts, customizable text appearance (font family, size, color), multi-display support, and the ability to display on external monitors or Sidecar iPads. All processing happens on-device—no cloud storage, no accounts, no tracking—making it a privacy-first alternative to web-based teleprompters.

## Key Takeaways

      First Launch on macOS
      Textream is a free, independently distributed app. Since it isn't notarized through the Mac App Store, macOS may block it on first launch. To fix this, open Terminal and run:
      xattr -cr /Applications/Textream.appThen right-click the app and choose Open. After the first launch, macOS remembers your choice and the app opens normally.
