## Summary

A practical guide to breaking through six-figure tech ceilings by shifting from technical merit to market positioning. The author argues that the difference between $100k and $300k engineers isn't coding ability—it's sales, networking, and understanding how hiring actually works. The core strategy: fix your resume to show business impact (revenue/time saved), bypass ATS filters by getting referrals through "side door" networking, pass the "Airport Test" (vibe check) in interviews by being likeable and communicative, and negotiate aggressively by never stating your number first.

## Key Takeaways

- **Resume = Sales collateral, not duty log**: Every bullet point needs a number (latency reduced, costs saved). "Maintained API" loses to "Refactored payment API, 200ms latency reduction, $4k/month savings."
- **Referrals beat Easy Apply**: Direct networking bypasses ATS filters and puts you in front of human decision-makers. Find engineers 2 years into a company and ask about culture, not jobs.
- **Technical skill is table stakes, soft skills are differentiators**: The "Airport Test"—would interviewers want to sit with you for 4 hours?—determines 90% of hiring decisions after you clear technical bars. Being personable and communicative beats being a solo coding genius.
- **Never quote first in salary negotiations**: Whoever speaks the number first loses leverage. Force employers to reveal their budget, then counter with +10% (they expect this).
- **The game isn't merit, it's positioning**: You can out-code others but still lose. Out-positioning others by understanding business-speak, building networks, and making yourself visible guarantees wins.

How to actually get a high paying job in tech (No BS)

You think the secret to a massive tech salary is solving more LeetCode hards than the next guy.

It isn’t.

If you can write code, you have the baseline. But the difference between a $100k engineer and a $300k engineer usually isn't syntax. It’s sales.

Most developers treat their career like a test they need to pass.

But in 2026, the market is too loud for that. You need to treat your career like a product you need to sell.

Here is the no-BS framework to landing the offer you actually want, without sending 500 resumes into the void.

1. Fix your "Brochure" (Resume)

Most tech resumes are boring lists of responsibilities.

"Maintained Java backend." " wrote unit tests." "Attended scrum meetings."

Nobody cares.

Hiring managers don’t buy effort. They buy results.

Scan your resume right now. If a bullet point doesn’t have a number in it, it’s weak.

Bad: "Refactored the payment API." Good: "Refactored payment API, reducing latency by 200ms and saving $4k/month in server costs."

You need to translate your code into money or time. That is the only language business people speak.

2. Skip the "Easy Apply" Button

Clicking "Easy Apply" on LinkedIn is essentially buying a lottery ticket where the prize is a rejection email.

The competition is too high. The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters are too aggressive.

You need to use the Side Door.

If you find a company you like:

1. Go to LinkedIn or X.

2. Search for "Software Engineer" at that company.

3. Find someone who looks like they’ve been there for 2 years (senior enough to be trusted, not so senior they are too busy).

4. Send a human message.

"Hey, I’m a Dev who specializes in [Your Stack]. I saw you guys just shipped [Feature]. That was slick. I’m thinking of applying for the open role, but wanted to ask—how’s the engineering culture there actually?"

You aren’t asking for a job. You’re asking for insight.

If they reply and you vibe, ask for a referral. Referrals skip the resume pile.

3. Pass the "Airport Test"

Technical interviews are stressful.

But here is the secret: Once you pass the technical threshold (you can actually code), the decision is 90% "Vibe Check."

It’s called the Airport Test. The interviewer is subconsciously asking:

"If I was stuck at an airport with this person for 4 hours during a delay, would I be miserable?"

If you are arrogant, defensive about your code, or silent, you fail.

- Talk while you code. Explain your thought process.

- Admit when you don’t know. "I'm not sure, but here is how I would figure it out."

- Be a human. Smile.

Being "good to work with" is a rarer skill than React.

4. Negotiate like you don't need it

You got the offer. The recruiter calls you.

"So, what are your salary expectations?"

DO NOT GIVE A NUMBER.

Whoever speaks the first number loses leverage. If you say $120k, and their budget was $160k, you just lost $40k in 5 seconds.

Here is the script:

"I’m focused on finding the right fit right now. I’m sure you have a budget for this role—what is the range you’re targeting?"

Make them say it.

And when they give you an offer? Always counter.

Recruiters expect you to negotiate. They usually leave $10k-$20k on the table specifically for this conversation.

Simply ask: "I’m really excited about the team. If we can get this to [Offer + 10%], I’d be ready to sign today."

Summary

1. Resume: Focus on revenue/time saved, not just tech stack.

2. Application: Don't apply cold. Get a referral from a peer.

3. Interview: Be likeable. Pass the Airport Test.

4. Offer: Never say the number first. Always counter.

The tech industry is full of people who are better at coding than you.

But you can beat them by being better at the game.
