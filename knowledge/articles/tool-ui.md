Tool UI is a React framework for conversation-native UIs that renders JSON tool outputs as inline, narrated, referenceable surfaces inside messages. Schema-first design with stable IDs ensures results stay consistent and reusable. Works with any LLM/provider and orchestration layer, providing a clean bridge from tool outputs to real product UX.
