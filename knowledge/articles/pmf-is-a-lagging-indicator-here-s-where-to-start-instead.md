Product-Market Fit is a lagging indicator—focus instead on whether you're solving a recurring problem with high-friction alternatives. The best products sit at the intersection of a recurring need and a low-friction solution (like Slack replacing email for team communication). Use the Hook Model to identify the frequency of the problem before building the solution. Get users to invest in the first 30 seconds of onboarding—this creates switching costs and dramatically increases retention. Friction reduction is the fastest way to form habits: every click, every decision, every moment of confusion breaks the habit loop. The old way builds for markets; the new way builds for habits, because habits stick.

## Key Takeaways
- Don't optimize for PMF first—optimize for habit formation (recurring solutions to recurring problems)
- Match solution speed to problem frequency: if the need happens 50+ times a day, the solution must be frictionless
- The first 30 seconds are critical—users who invest early (create, customize, invite) are exponentially more likely to stay
- Reduce friction ruthlessly: every extra click, decision, or moment of confusion breaks the habit loop
- Build for habits, not markets—markets shift, habits stick

PMF is a lagging indicator. Here’s where to start instead.

# Stop focusing on PMF

Founders are obsessed with Product-Market Fit, understandably so. They track signups, watch churn numbers and check the reviews. And yeah, all that matters. Solving a problem is the way to enter a market and Product-Market Fit tells you people want what you're selling.

But it’s such a lagging indicator.

The question you should start with instead: “Am I developing a solution or a habit?”

“Habits Are Recurring Solutions to Recurring Problems” - James Clear

Not all problems are worth solving because not all problems recur. If you build something brilliant that solves a problem your user has once a year: filing taxes, booking a vacation rental, you don't have a habit. You have a utility. And most utilities are brutal businesses to start because you have to re-acquire that customer every single time they need you. Not impossible, but much harder.

To build a habit, you need to own a recurring moment in someone's day or week. A moment that keeps coming back. Think about the apps you use every single day without thinking. They're all sitting at the intersection of a recurring problem and a low-friction solution. That intersection is where habit-forming solutions live.

## The Hook Model

In Nir Eyal's Hooked, the loop is simple: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, Investment.

But most products skip step one. They don't accurately identify the recurring problem. They fall in love with their solution before they understand the frequency of the pain.

Look at Slack. Why did it replace email for internal communications? Because the problem, "I need to coordinate with my team right now,” happens 50+ times a day. Email was technically a solution, but it was slow and asynchronous. It was designed for a different era.

By 2022, 57% of workers said they preferred messaging apps like Slack over email for internal comms. That's a habit shift. Slack fit the frequency of the problem. Email didn't.

At Gamma, we realized that knowledge workers face the problem "I need to communicate a complex idea professionally" at least weekly, sometimes daily.

The main existing solution was PowerPoint, a 40-year-old tool built for a world where people printed slides on transparencies. PowerPoint was massively high-friction. You spend 90% of your time aligning boxes and picking fonts, and 10% on the actual story.

Gamma became a habit because we made the solution as fast as the problem. You have an idea now. You need a deck now. Done.

## "What Would This Look Like If It Were Fun?"

This is another James Clear question that changed how we build. If your solution works but feels like work, you're fighting human nature. And human nature wins every time.

At Gamma, we asked ourselves: Why does making slides feel so painful? Because the tools are slow. They're tedious. They're designed for designers, not for people who just need to get an idea out of their head. We made it feel like playing with blocks instead of filling out tax forms.

Hooked products create internal triggers. Eventually, the push notifications don't matter anymore.

> If the user feels a specific discomfort or need, like boredom, confusion, or deadline pressure, and the solution they rush to automatically, is your product, that's when you know you've won.

## The First 30 Seconds Are Life or Death

The Investment Phase is the final step in the Hook Model. It's where users put something into your product, like content, data, customization, reputation. And this is why the first 30 seconds of your onboarding experience are everything.

Average 30-second retention for most apps is about 53-60%. That means nearly half your users are gone before they even see your value.

If a user invests time during that first session, like creating something, customizing a setting, inviting a teammate, they've just built switching costs without even realizing it. They've made your solution theirs.

> If you get users to invest in the first 30 seconds, they're exponentially more likely to stay. If you don't, they churn. And they almost never come back.

## Friction Reduction

Friction reduction is a sure-fire way to get the user to invest, and eventually create a habit.

What I learned from the first iPhone which came in 2007, is that every extra click, every extra decision, every moment of confusion is a crack in your habit loop.

I remember it took me 3 to 4 clicks to check my email on the iPhone, and when I did the same using my desktop PC, it took 12 to 15 clicks. I knew instantly how powerful reducing the ‘steps to outcome’ is.

The best products feel like they read your mind. They anticipate what you need before you realize you need it. It’s looks magical because it shows the understanding of the recurring problem better than anyone else.

The old way is building for a market. The new way is to build for a habit. Because markets shift. Habits stick.
