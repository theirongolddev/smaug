## Summary

Obie Fernandez shares insights from his role as CTO at ZAR about how the AI era demands a new approach to defining individual value. Rather than generic competence, people need to articulate and cultivate a specific, demonstrable superpower—something AI cannot easily replicate. He frames this through the emerging "product engineer" model: people who combine entrepreneurial thinking, scientific methodology, and deep technical skill. Obie's own superpower is audacity—the ability to envision radical futures and drag others into uncomfortable transformation. The article provides a practical framework for discovering your superpower by examining patterns in wins, what people ask you for, what you'd do for free, and what remains valuable in the age of AI.

## Key Takeaways

- **Superpowers are specific, not generic**: "What are you good at?" is not the right question—it's about what makes you irreplaceably valuable and changes outcomes when you enter a room
- **The AI competitive bar shifted higher**: If an AI can do what you do 80% as well, it's not a superpower—your advantage must be in areas AI amplifies rather than replaces
- **Product engineers combine three capabilities**: Entrepreneurial thinking + scientific methodology + deep technical skill; they form hypotheses, ship experiments, measure results
- **The four-question framework**: Identify patterns in wins (how you won, not just that you won), learn what people consistently bring to you for help, find what you'd do for free, assess AI replicability
- **Audacity has outperformed expertise repeatedly**: Obie's track record shows that bold bets on emerging technology, executed with conviction and support systems, outperform incremental improvements in established domains
- **Judgment, taste, relationships matter**: These are the hardest things for AI to replicate and represent genuine human superpowers in 2026+

What is Your Superpower?

I had a call today with someone I hadn't spoken to in a while. They're technically sharp, comfortable with modern AI tools, thinking about what's next in their career. The conversation turned into an impromptu coaching session that crystallized something I've been thinking about a lot lately.

I kept asking one question, over and over: What is your superpower?

Not "what are you good at." Not "what do you enjoy." I wanted to know what makes them irreplaceably valuable. What's the thing that, when you walk into a room, changes the game?

They kinda struggled with it, at least based on what I was hoping to hear. That's okay. Most people do.

Here's why it's important to be able to answer that question confidently, framed in what's going on at ZAR where I've recently joined as CTO.

## The Product Engineer Era

At ZAR, we've evolved toward an "AI forward" approach. Our new engineering team model centers on the product engineer - not just a coder, not just a PM, but someone who combines entrepreneurial thinking with scientific methodology and deep technical skill.

Here's what that actually means: a product engineer doesn't wait for a spec. They identify problems, form hypotheses, ship experiments, and measure results. They're obsessed with a small set of metrics that matter. They use AI as a force multiplier, not a crutch.

When I interview candidates now, I'm not just evaluating whether they can code. I'm evaluating whether they can think. Can they form an opinion about what we should build? Can they defend it? Can they change their mind when the data says otherwise?

## The Scrappy Threshold

Eventually the conversation landed on something interesting. They said their superpower was thriving in the "scrappy" early stages - that bridge between dev work and customer-facing roles. They come alive when things are ambiguous and chaotic.

That's actually a real superpower. Not everyone can operate when there's no playbook. Some people need structure to perform. Others create structure where none exists.

The question is: can you articulate it? Can you point to the moments where your superpower saved the day? Can you help someone else understand why they should bet on you?

## My Superpower

Since I'm asking the question, I should answer it myself.

My superpower is audacity. Not giving a damn about the way things were done before now. It's being able to look people in the eye and say: because of AI and everything that's happening that if we don't do things radically differently, we're dead in the water. None of it is going to work and we're just wasting time. And then getting them to actually act accordingly, not only convincing and motivating them, but also giving them a framework and set of tools and support structure where they can execute successfully.

I've done this in multiple settings over the years. At ThoughtWorks in 2005, we were first in shifting mindshare of top talent from Java and .NET to Ruby. I was the first out of hundreds of consultants worldwide billing clients to do Ruby on Rails work, at John Deere in Atlanta. Two years later, 40% of our billable work was Ruby. From zero to 40% in two years, through urgency, evangelism, and just doing shit that other people didn't have the vision or stomach to do. Manifesting what I could see in the future before anyone else believed it was real.

That's audacity. It's not a technical skill. It's not domain expertise. It's the willingness to be wrong loudly, to drag people into an uncomfortable future, and to stake your reputation on a vision that sounds crazy until it's obvious.

Right now at ZAR, I'm doing it again. We've flattened all engineering titles to simply "Product Engineer." We're eliminating roadmaps because you don't need a roadmap at our stage, you need relentless experimentation. A culture of experimentation, of validating and invalidating assumptions every day. We're killing ceremony, backlogs, performance reviews. The only thing that matters is metrics and whether the line goes up.

My CTO assistant (the AI, not a person) told me: if you have A+ players, this will work amazingly. If you have B players or people used to taking orders, it'll fall flat on its face. That's the bet. That's audacity. Let's find out if it works.

## Finding Your Answer

If you're struggling with "What is your superpower?", here's how I'd approach answering the question:

1. Look for patterns in your wins. Not just what you accomplished, but how you accomplished it. Did you win because you worked harder than everyone else? Because you saw something others missed? Because you could translate between groups that didn't understand each other? But that's not enough...

2. Ask what people consistently come to you for. Not your job title. What challenges do they actually bring to you? When something breaks, when something's stuck, when something needs to start from scratch - where do people look?

3. Consider what you'd do for free, just because it's fun. The thing you can't stop doing even when no one's paying attention. That's probably where your superpower lives.

4. Compare to AI agents. Here's the hard truth of 2026: if an AI agent can do what you do 80% as well as you, it's not a superpower anymore. Your superpower has to be the thing that AI amplifies, not replaces. The judgment, the taste, the relationships, the intuition born from experience.

## The Uncomfortable Follow-Up

I suggested my friend consult Claude on this question. Not because Claude will give them the answer, but because talking through it with an AI that doesn't let you off the hook is clarifying. Make it keep asking you "why?" and "what do you mean by that?" until you've actually said something worthwhile.

Only then come back and tell me what you figured out.

Bottom line: The human talent that will thrive in this new era are individuals who know exactly what superpower they bring to the scenario. They don't pitch themselves on generic competence. They pitch on specific, demonstrable, hard-to-replicate value.

So, what's your superpower?
