Researchers at MIT present a novel approach to solving catastrophic forgetting in neural networks—the problem where training on new tasks causes models to lose previously learned capabilities. Rather than relying on external reward functions (which are difficult to define), they propose using the model itself in dual modes: a "teacher" that receives demonstrations in context, and a "student" trained to match the teacher's token probability distributions. This in-context learning signal proves gentle enough to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling models to sequentially learn multiple skills while retaining all of them. The method has theoretical grounding equivalent to implicit-reward reinforcement learning.

## Key Takeaways

- **Catastrophic Forgetting Problem**: Sequential training on new tasks causes LLMs to forget previously learned knowledge, a critical limitation in continual learning.
- **Self-Distillation Solution**: Using the same model in "teacher" (with demonstrations) and "student" (without) modes creates a learning signal that preserves existing capabilities.
- **On-Policy Learning Without Explicit Rewards**: Avoids the need to define external reward functions by leveraging the model's existing in-context learning ability.
- **Multi-Task Sequential Learning**: Experimental results show the approach enables learning three different tasks sequentially while maintaining performance on all of them.
- **Theoretical Grounding**: The method is mathematically equivalent to reinforcement learning with implicit rewards, providing theoretical justification beyond empirical results.
- **Token-Level Optimization**: Updates the student's weights to minimize KL divergence between student and teacher token probability distributions at each position.
