# Memory as Reasoning

A foundational piece exploring why AI memory should be treated as a dynamic reasoning task rather than static storage. The article makes the case that logical reasoning enables superhuman capability in memory systems.

Key insight: Memory is not a retrieval problem—it's a prediction problem. This reframes how we think about building AI agent memory systems beyond simple database lookups.

Discusses approaches to agent memory systems where logical reasoning is the foundation, moving beyond traditional retrieval-augmented generation patterns.
