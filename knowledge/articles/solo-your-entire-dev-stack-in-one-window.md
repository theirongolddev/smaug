Desktop app for managing entire local dev stack: auto-detect processes, start/stop everything together, auto-restart on crash. One window with full visibility (green/red/gray states), keyboard-first design, MCP integration for Claude Code to manage processes. Built with Tauri (~20MB), works on Mac/Windows/Linux, shared solo.yml for team consistency, Raycast integration. Free plan covers 3 projects/12 processes; Pro unlimited.

## Key Takeaways
- Single window replaces juggling tabs for npm dev, workers, logs, webhooks, etc.
- Auto-detects processes, auto-restarts on crash, file-change watches for reload
- MCP server lets Claude Code restart workers and manage stack without context switching
- solo.yml in repo ensures team consistency (no outdated README setup instructions)
- Keyboard-first, Raycast integration, lightweight Tauri-based (vs Electron bloat)
- CLI/interactive terminal support, file change watchers, security confirmations

Works with any stackStop juggling terminal tabs. Configure your processes once, start everything with one click, and get notified when something crashes. The IssueYou've been here beforenpm run dev in one tab. Queue workers in another. Logs in a third. What was that Stripe webhook command again? Half of them have silently crashed and you don't know it.Silent failuresYou're debugging code that was never even running. Your dev server is running in two different tabs and your changes aren't showing up in either.Setup amnesiaYou haven't touched this project in a week. What port does it run on? Was it npm run dev or npm start? Did you need Redis first? 20 minutes gone.Project jugglingWorking on multiple projects makes it worse. Different stacks, different commands, different tabs. The cognitive load compounds. The FixOne window. Full visibility.Solo is a desktop app that manages your dev processes. Add a project, define what needs to run, and Solo handles the rest. Auto-start, auto-restart, notifications when something needs attention. Works with any stack  Auto-detects processes for: What Solo actually doesManages your entire local dev stack. No bloat, no configuration rabbit holes.Start your entire stack at onceAdd a project, we'll auto-detect your processes (or add your own), and hit start. Everything spins up together. When you're done, shut it all down with one click.No more opening six tabs and trying to remember what this project needs.Auto-restart when things crashProcesses die. Solo notices and restarts them automatically. Set up glob patterns so file changes restart the relevant process too.No more running stale queue workers because you forgot to restart after a code change.See everything at a glanceGreen means running. Red means crashed. Gray means off. You always know the state of your stack without clicking through tabs or guessing.If something's wrong, you'll see it.Built for teamsCommit your solo.yml to the repo and everyone gets the same stack. No more outdated READMEs or Slack messages asking how to run the project.New teammate? They're up and running in minutes, not hours. Power User FeaturesBuilt for developers who live in their toolsKeyboard-first design, deep integrations, and AI-ready from day oneLet Claude manage your processesSolo speaks MCP. Claude Code can restart your crashed worker while you keep coding. Ask your AI to spin up your stack before you start work. Process management without context switching.Claude Code — solo❯Restart the queue worker and show me the output●Solo MCP(restart_process) └ process: "queue:work" ✓Process restarted successfullyRaycast integrationControl Solo from Raycast.
