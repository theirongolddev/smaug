**Faster.dev** is a comprehensive course and resource library for experienced engineers learning to use AI (primarily Claude Code) for rapid software development. Aaron Francis teaches how to ship 4K+ LOC features with full testing in ~1 hour through systematic use of AI, better mental models around context management, and proper guardrails.

## Key Takeaways

- AI amplifies engineering skills; it doesn't replace them. The ability to architect systems, understand trade-offs, and know "good" implementation is now more valuable.
- **Systems beat prompts.** Successful fast development relies on slash commands, skills files, MCP configs, proper testing, and CI/CD—not clever one-off prompts.
- **Speed + quality are aligned through discipline.** Tests, architecture, and CI/CD don't slow you down; they're what enable sustainable speed.
- Avoid SOTA-chasing and hype; focus on principles that transfer across tools as the landscape evolves.
- The course includes slash command templates, skills files, MCP configs, video series, and live project logs showing real shipping with users and revenue.

Your engineering skills just became 10x more valuable.Ship better software, fasterYour skills just becamedramatically more valuable.You've been hearing it everywhere: AI is going to replace software engineers. It's over. We're cooked. We had a good run. Software is a solved problem. Nobody needs developers anymore. Become a promptooor or get left behind.That's not what's actually happening.What's actually happening is that the skills you've spent years building (architecture, systems thinking, knowing what "good" looks like) just became dramatically more valuable. AI doesn't replace that! It just amplifies it.You can one-shot the boilerplate you've been rewriting for the past decade.You can generate deployment configs instead of googling for thirty minutes.AI can battle CI failures on your behalf.You can write vastly more tests than ever before because AI handles the tedious setup while you think about edge cases.But you still need to know what to build, how to structure it, and what "done right" means.Fast doesn't have to mean sloppy anymore.Moving fast with AI is more about systems than anything else. Slash commands that handle common workflows. Skills files that teach Claude your patterns. Rules that keep output consistent. Static analysis that catches bugs before you even run the code. Tests that let you ship confidently. CI/CD that catches mistakes before production.The developers moving fastest right now have better systems. Not better prompts.I've been shipping software for over two decades. In the past year, I've shipped more than the previous several years combined. Not because I'm working more hours (I have four kids, I'm definitely not) but because I built systems that make speed and quality the same thing.Discipline is speed.Tests aren't the thing that slows me down. They're the thing that lets me move fast without worrying! I never really enjoyed writing tests, but now it's a breeze. And now I don't have to fight with getting GitHub actions set up correctly, for the millionth time.Leading edge, not bleeding edge.No benchmark maxxing. No chasing whatever's trending on Hacker News this week. No academic papers. No impressive demos that never ship. I don't care about SOTA scores or burning a billion tokens while I sleep. I care about code that works, products that make money, and software that actually gets used. This is for builders, not researchers. I'll experiment with every new tool that comes out, but what I teach are the systems and workflows that actually add value, not just the ones that are interesting or new.I'm giving you everything! My complete setup. The videos that show how it works. The series that go deep on specific skills. You can follow along as I build multiple projects. Take what works. Move faster.You've been adapting your whole career.New frameworks. New languages. New paradigms. On-prem, cloud, containers, serverless... back to cloud.That's what software engineering is!AI is the next shift, and it's a big one. The good news is, your experience compounds. All those patterns you've learned, the mistakes you've made, the instincts you've built all transfer.The tools will keep changing. Six months from now, we'll be using things that don't exist yet. That's exactly why I focus on principles over tutorials. How to structure context. How to build guardrails. How to know when AI helps and when it hurts. Skills that transfer to whatever comes next.You're an experienced engineer in the middle of the most exciting shift in how software gets built. Let's go.What you getThe system. The tools. The journey.The system: The mental models behind AI-assisted development. How to structure context. When to reach for agents vs simple prompts. How to build guardrails that actually work. Dedicated video series on Claude Code, designing with AI, and more. The judgment that comes from shipping real products with these tools.The tools: Slash commands, skills files, MCP configs, workflows, templates. The actual resources I use every day, ready to drop into your setup. I test every new release so you don't have to. When something's worth your time, you get it. When it's hype, I'll tell you.The journey: Watch me build actual products as I build them. Real projects, real users, real revenue. You'll see how I approach problems, recover from mistakes, and adapt when plans change. Plus a private forum where members share what's working and help each other ship.01Video SeriesStructured courses that take you from concept to mastery.02Project LogsFollow behind the scenes as I build real products, with real users and real revenue.

Every video is packed full of useful information explaining concisely."— Derek DoorNot ready to buy? Stay in the loop.04FAQWhen is this launching?First week of February!We'll launch many of the projects that week so you can see exactly what you're able to build, and then the whole platform will be open that week as well.What makes you the AI expert?I'm a software engineer who's been building and shipping products for over two decades, and teaching developers for over a decade. I've mass-adopted AI tooling faster as fast as I can, not because I'm smarter, but because I have the time, the obsession, and the context to go deep. I test every new release, build real projects with these tools daily, and document what actually works.You're getting the filtered version: the setups, patterns, and workflows that survived contact with production code.Can I use this stuff today?Well, not today today, because we haven't launched. But when we do launch in February, yes!The slash commands, skills files, MCP configs, and rules files are all downloadable. Copy them into your setup, tweak them for your stack, and start using them immediately. The videos show you how everything works together.I'm optimizing for you to get up to speed quickly. If you want to watch a bunch of videos, that's also great. But you should see improvements from day one.What tools do you cover?Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Amp, Midjourney, and v0. Primarily Claude Code. I cover when to use which, and how to set them up properly. The MCP servers, slash commands, and skills files work with Claude Code specifically, but the principles apply everywhereWill moving faster mean lower quality?No, that's the whole point. The systems I share (tests, CI/CD, proper architecture) are what make speed sustainable. You move faster because you're not constantly fixing mistakes, rewriting code, or debugging production issues.What if AI tools change tomorrow?They will, and you've dealt with this before. Remember when jQuery was everywhere? When we all learned React? When serverless was the new thing? You adapted then, you'll adapt now. The difference is your fundamentals transfer. I focus on principles that work across tools, and I update the specific implementations as things evolve.How often is new content added?Regularly. Video series are released as I build them, project logs are updated as projects progress, and new resources are added as I develop them. Follow along as I ship.
