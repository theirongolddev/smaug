Shu Ding's guide to building React components that survive real-world conditions beyond the happy path. Most components work until they hit server rendering, hydration, multiple instances, concurrent rendering, async children, portals, transitions, activity wrapping, or data leaking. The article walks through 10 defensive patterns to handle each: make it server-proof (move browser APIs to useEffect), hydration-proof (inject sync script before paint), instance-proof (useId for unique IDs), concurrent-proof (React.cache to deduplicate queries), composition-proof (context over cloneElement), portal-proof (ownerDocument.defaultView), transition-proof (startTransition for smooth animations), activity-proof (media attribute for CSS), leak-proof (taintUniqueValue/taintObjectReference), and future-proof (state over useMemo for persistence). The thesis: these aren't edge cases anymore—they're the normal conditions of modern React with Server Components, concurrent rendering, and complex component trees.

## Key Takeaways
- Move browser APIs into useEffect to prevent server rendering crashes
- Use inline synchronous scripts before browser paint to prevent hydration flashes
- useId() for unique identifiers when component is used multiple times
- React.cache() deduplicates queries across concurrent renders in Server Components
- Prefer context over React.cloneElement—works with Server Components and async children
- ownerDocument.defaultView finds the correct window for portals and pop-outs
- startTransition() enables smooth view transitions in React 19
- useLayoutEffect + media='not all' prevents CSS side effects in hidden Activity components
- experimental_taintUniqueValue/taintObjectReference prevents sensitive data from leaking to client
- useState over useMemo for correctness—useMemo is performance hint, not guarantee

Most components are built for the happy path. They work—until they don’t. The real world is hostile. Server rendering. Hydration. Multiple instances. Concurrent rendering. Async children. Portals... Your component could face all of them. The question is whether it survives.
The real test isn’t whether your component works on your current page. It’s whether it works when someone else uses it—in conditions you didn’t plan for. That’s when fragile components break.
Here’s how to make it survive.

Make It Server-Proof
Make It Hydration-Proof
Make It Instance-Proof
Make It Concurrent-Proof
Make It Composition-Proof
Make It Portal-Proof
Make It Transition-Proof
Make It Activity-Proof
Make It Leak-Proof
Make It Future-Proof*

#Make It Server-Proof
A simple theme provider that reads the user’s preference from localStorage:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(
    localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light'
  )

  return <div className={theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: Crashes in SSR—reads theme from localStorage
But localStorage doesn’t exist on the server. In Next.js, Remix, or any SSR framework, this crashes the build. Move browser APIs into useEffect:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  useEffect(() => {
    setTheme(localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light')
  }, [])

  return <div className={theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: useEffect defers localStorage to client-side only
Now it renders on the server without crashing.
#Make It Hydration-Proof
I also call this waterproof. The server-safe version works, but users see a flash. Server renders light, client hydrates, then the effect runs and switches to dark:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  useEffect(() => {
    setTheme(localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light')
  }, [])

  return <div className={theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: Flash of wrong theme—useEffect runs after hydration
Inject a synchronous script that sets the correct value before browser paints and React hydrates. The DOM already has the right class when React takes over:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="theme">{children}</div>
      <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `
        try {
          const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light'
          document.getElementById('theme').className = theme
        } catch (e) {}
      `}} />
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: Inline script sets theme before browser paints
No mismatch, no flash.
#Make It Instance-Proof
The hydration-proof version targets a hardcoded id="theme". But what if someone uses two ThemeProviders?
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ThemeProvider><MainContent /></ThemeProvider>
      <AlwaysLightThemeContent />
      <ThemeProvider><Sidebar /></ThemeProvider>
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: Multiple instances—both scripts target the same ID
Both scripts fight over the same element. Use useId to generate stable, unique IDs per instance:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const id = useId()
  return (
    <>
      <div id={id}>{children}</div>
      <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `
        try {
          const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light'
          document.getElementById('${id}').className = theme
        } catch (e) {}
      `}} />
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: useId generates unique IDs per instance
Now multiple instances coexist safely.
#Make It Concurrent-Proof
Now let’s make the theme server-driven. A Server Component that fetches user preferences:
async function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const prefs = await db.preferences.get(userId)

  return <div className={prefs.theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: Server Component fetches preferences from database
Similar to before, render it in two places and you might get two identical database queries. Wrap the query in React.cache to deduplicate within a single request:
import { cache } from 'react'

const getPreferences = cache(
  userId => db.preferences.get(userId)
)

async function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const prefs = await getPreferences(userId)

  return <div className={prefs.theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: React cache() deduplicates concurrent calls
Same query, called from anywhere, hits the database once.
#Make It Composition-Proof
Sometimes you want to pass data to children as props, which traditionally meant using React.cloneElement:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  return React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
    return React.cloneElement(child, { theme })
  })
}
Sidenote: Passes theme to children via cloneElement
But with React Server Components, React.lazy, or "use cache", children might be a Promise or an opaque reference—cloneElement won't work. Use context instead:
const ThemeContext = createContext('light')

function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
Sidenote: Context works everywhere—server, client, async
Children read the theme through useContext—no prop drilling, no cloning.
#Make It Portal-Proof
A theme provider with a keyboard shortcut—Cmd+D to toggle dark mode:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')

  useEffect(() => {
    const toggle = (e) => {
      if (e.metaKey && e.key === 'd') {
        e.preventDefault()
        setTheme(t => t === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')
      }
    }
    window.addEventListener('keydown', toggle)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', toggle)
  }, [])

  return <div className={theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: Global keyboard shortcut to toggle theme
But if someone renders the app inside a pop-out window, iframe, or via createPortal, the shortcut stops working. The listener is attached to the parent window, not the one your component lives in. Use ownerDocument.defaultView:
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')
  const ref = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const win = ref.current?.ownerDocument.defaultView || window
    const toggle = (e) => {
      if (e.metaKey && e.key === 'd') {
        e.preventDefault()
        setTheme(t => t === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')
      }
    }
    win.addEventListener('keydown', toggle)
    return () => win.removeEventListener('keydown', toggle)
  }, [])

  return <div ref={ref} className={theme}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: ownerDocument.defaultView finds the correct window
Now the shortcut works in any window context.
#Make It Transition-Proof
A settings panel that toggles between simple and advanced views:
function ThemeSettings() {
  const [showAdvanced, setShowAdvanced] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      {showAdvanced ? <AdvancedPanel /> : <SimplePanel />}
      <button onClick={() => setShowAdvanced(!showAdvanced)}>
        {showAdvanced ? 'Simple' : 'Advanced'}
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: Simple state toggle between two panels
Wrap it in React 19’s <ViewTransition>, and nothing animates—the panels just snap. State updates must go through startTransition:
function ThemeSettings() {
  const [showAdvanced, setShowAdvanced] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      {showAdvanced ? <AdvancedPanel /> : <SimplePanel />}
      <button onClick={() =>
        startTransition(() => setShowAdvanced(!showAdvanced))
      }>
        {showAdvanced ? 'Simple' : 'Advanced'}
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: startTransition enables the view transition
Now the transition animates smoothly.
#Make It Activity-Proof
A theme component that injects CSS variables via a <style> tag:
function DarkTheme({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <style>{`
        :root {
          --bg: #000;
          --fg: #fff;
        }
      `}</style>
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: Injects global CSS variables via style tag
But if you wrap it in <Activity>, the dark theme persists even when hidden. <Activity> preserves DOM, and <style> has DOM-level side effects—it modifies :root variables globally. React can't automatically clean up these side effects. Set media="not all" to disable the styles when hidden:
function DarkTheme({ children }) {
  const ref = useRef(null)

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!ref.current) return
    ref.current.media = 'all'
    return () => ref.current.media = 'not all'
  }, [])

  return (
    <>
      <style ref={ref}>{`
        :root {
          --bg: #000;
          --fg: #fff;
        }
      `}</style>
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
Sidenote: useLayoutEffect sets media='not all' when hidden and restores it when unhidden
Now hidden components won't have the dark theme applied.
#Make It Leak-Proof
A Server Component that passes a user object (including a session token) to another theming component. Valid use case—you need the data on the server. You might know UserThemeConfig is a Server Component and it’s safe to pass the data to it.
async function Dashboard() {
  const user = await getUser()

  return <UserThemeConfig user={user} />
}
Sidenote: Dashboard passes user (with token) to another component
However, you don’t know UserThemeConfig’s exact behavior, what it renders, or what a future version might do. You don’t maintain it.
Also because UserThemeConfig does not create user, it might not know that user has a sensitive token property. You do not control that component, so you cannot assume it will not pass that to a Client Component somewhere in its tree. The token gets serialized and sent to the client. Use React’s experimental taintUniqueValue to mark the token as server-only. If that value is ever passed to a Client Component, React throws. To block an entire object instead of a single value, use taintObjectReference.
import { experimental_taintUniqueValue } from 'react'

async function Dashboard() {
  const user = await getUser()

  experimental_taintUniqueValue(
    'Do not pass the user token to the client.',
    user,
    user.token
  )

  return <UserThemeConfig user={user} />
}
Sidenote: taintUniqueValue blocks user.token from being sent to the client
If that component’s code (or a future refactor by someone else on the team) tries to pass user.token to a Client Component, React throws with your message. Valid use case stays; the token never leaks.
#Make It Future-Proof*
This is a concept to understand: be defensive. It is not a pattern to apply everywhere.
A theme that generates random accent colors on mount:
function ThemeProvider({ baseTheme, children }) {
  const colors = useMemo(
    () => getRandomColors(baseTheme),
    [baseTheme]
  )

  return <div style={colors}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: useMemo caches the generated colors
But useMemo is a performance hint, not a semantic guarantee. React discards cached values during HMR, and reserves the right to do so for offscreen components or features that don’t exist yet. If React discards the cache, your theme flickers to different colors. Use state when correctness depends on persistence:
function ThemeProvider({ baseTheme, children }) {
  const [colors, setColors] = useState(() => generateAccentColors(baseTheme))
  const [prevTheme, setPrevTheme] = useState(baseTheme)

  if (baseTheme !== prevTheme) {
    setPrevTheme(baseTheme)
    setColors(generateAccentColors(baseTheme))
  }

  return <div style={colors}>{children}</div>
}
Sidenote: useState provides semantic persistence guarantee
Now colors stay stable regardless of React’s internal optimizations.

These aren’t edge cases. They’re the new normal. The components that break? They weren’t fragile. They were built for yesterday’s React. We’re building for tomorrow’s.
