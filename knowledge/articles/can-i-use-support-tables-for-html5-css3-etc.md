                        If a feature you're looking for is not available on the site, you can vote to have it included. Better yet, if you've done the research you can even submit it yourself!
                    
                
                
                    
                        You can import usage data from your Google Analytics account and see exactly how well a feature is supported among your own site's visitors. Look under the Settings panel to get started!
                    
                
                
                    
                        Usage data for all countries and continents can be imported via the Settings panel.
                    
                
                
                    
                        By default, older browser versions are only shown if they have >= 0.5% usage share. You can increase or decrease this value from the Settings panel. 
                    
                
                
                    
                        Each feature support table includes a "Usage relative" button. This will resize each browser version cell to be relative to the amount of support it has for the selected usage source.
