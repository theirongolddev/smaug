## Summary

A candid playbook from a top 1% earner (peak $800k/year) on how to climb corporate hierarchies by mastering politics, perception, and leverage rather than merit. The author dissects the corporate matrix: companies promote "the paint" (visible, influential) over "the engine" (reliable, essential), reward those who make managers' lives easier, and punish loyalty with lower lifetime earnings. Success requires strategic incompetence (intentionally failing at low-value tasks), internal networking (building relationships across the org, not just your team), visibility theater (being seen doing work), and treating your career as a business you're selling, not a family you belong to.

## Key Takeaways

- **Meritocracy is a myth**: Companies promote perception, not performance. "The engine" (the hardworking person solving daily problems) stays trapped because they're too valuable in their current role. "The paint" (the visible, influential person) gets promoted because removing them creates no operational loss.
- **Being visible > being productive**: A crisis solved at 8 PM gets more credit than one solved at 2 PM. Speaking in meetings matters more than the quality of your silence. If you can't broadcast your wins, they don't count.
- **Manage up, not sideways**: Your boss is a scared middle manager terrified of their own boss. Make their life easier (identify their pain point and solve it) and they'll protect and advocate for you. They need you successful more than you need them.
- **Strategic incompetence protects your time**: If you volunteer for low-value admin work, that's now your permanent job. Instead, say "I'd love to help, but given X deadline, I can't get to it until next week"—they'll find someone else.
- **Network internally like your future depends on it**: Your current peer is your next hiring manager. Competent people move to better companies and hire people they trust. If you're forgotten, you don't get the text when they leave. This is how careers are actually built.
- **Loyalty to corporations is a tax on lifetime earnings**: Average internal raise = 3%. External = 10-20%. Interview quarterly, even when happy. Treat your employer as a client, not family. Be willing to walk away.
- **Translate everything to the three levers**: Executives only care about risk, revenue, and costs. If your daily work doesn't tie to one of these, you're invisible and next on the layoff list.
- **Mentors ≠ Sponsors**: Mentors teach you the job. Sponsors use their influence to move you up the ladder. You need both.
- **Visibility and budget size = organizational importance**: A manager with a $50k budget is easy to lay off. A manager with a $2M budget is "strategic." Fight for resources and headcount—bigger budgets signal importance.

How To Win "The Game" Of Corporate America

For most the most part, I think I've won Corporate America.

I’ve  mostly been a top 1% earner for my age, with my best year being $800k and on track to leave the matrix by 40 (45 being the absolute latest).

I'm in my 30s now and on track to escape the matrix by 40, 45 the absolute latest.

I started my career at a $35k base salary. My first commission check was $11.

How did I make a massive jump like that?

First, it helps being in a commission oriented role (and tbh the ZIRP era had a lot to do with the $800k year, I'll never touch that again).

Second, it’s knowing how to “play the game” in Corporate America.

I don’t say all of this to flex. I say it because if you met me in person, you wouldn’t think I’m a genius. I’m actually the opposite, I’m kind of dumb (lol). I just work hard, have some street smarts, and understand what motivates people.

That’s why I ended up as a recruiter and not a SWE at FAANG or as an investment banker on Wall Street.

I say it because if I can do it, anyone can do it.

So let me tell you a hard truth:

The system is not designed to reward you for working hard. The system is designed to extract value from you until you are too expensive to keep.

Most people play the game assuming that if they are “good at their job,” they will be safe and successful.

That’s a lie.

I have spent over a decade placing people while watching careers rise and fall. I have seen the guy who works 80hrs/week get fired, and the guy who works 20hrs/week get promoted.

Success in Corporate America isn’t about output. It is about leverage, perception, and politics. The larger the company you work at, the more this holds true.

Here is the actual playbook for winning a game that wasn’t built for you:

Part 1: Meritocracy

The most dangerous thing you can believe is that your company is an actual meritocracy.

In your first week, your manager tells you, “The best ideas win here.” In reality, the safest ideas win, or the ideas that make the VP look good win.

One of my mentors who ended up becoming a VP of Sales told me companies tend to categorize people in 2 ways:

1. The Engine: These people keep the lights on. They’re reliable and get the job done and keep to themselves.

2. The Paint: These people make things look good, present well, and have the perception that they’re valuable.

Here is the reality: Companies promote the paint a lot more often than the engine.

Why would they? If you are the best person at fixing the daily problems, promoting you creates a massive headache for your manager because they need you right where you are. You have become too valuable to promote.

The people who climb are the ones who detach themselves from the daily grind. They focus on being visible as much as they focus on being productive.

If you want to succeed, you have to stop trying to be the hardest worker in the room. You have to start being the most influential worker in the room.

Sounds the same, but they’re not. Now you can certainly be both (I was for a while), but the influence comes first.

Note: You can be “the paint” while also being “the engine”. That’s a good combo. But being “the engine” alone will only give you a glass ceiling.

Part 2: Speak To Your Audience

I recently read the article from the [IT Director making $280k](https://x.com/it_unprofession/status/2014141526599950728) which inspired this article. There he spends almost zero time on actual technology.

He spends a lot of his time “translating.”

This is the biggest gap I see as a recruiter. I talk to brilliant candidates who are stuck at $120-$150k because they can't speak to their audience. They don’t know how to dumb it down and translate it into actual English where the stakeholders can understand.

Or, they can't speak up to Executives and focus on what really matters to them. Executives do not care about your effort, they care about risk, revenue, and costs.

If you cannot tie your daily tasks to one of those three levers, you are invisible (and probably next on the chopping block for layoffs).

Part 3: Strategic Incompetence

You have a limited amount of political capital and energy every day. If you spend it on low level tasks you’ll lose.

The most successful people I know are masters of my old boss calls “Strategic Incompetence”

This means intentionally being bad (or slow) at the things that do not get you promoted, so that people stop asking you to do them.

If you are the person who always volunteers to take notes, fixing the printer, updating CRMs/reports, or whatever low level annoying tasks related to your industry, guess what? That’s now part of your job and expectation every time.

When asked to do low value administrative work, do not say “No.” That makes you look difficult. Instead, say something like: “I’d love to help, but given the deadline on X project, I wouldn’t be able to get to this until next week. Is that okay?”

The majority of the time they will find someone else. You have protected your time for the work that matters aka the work the big guys upstairs actually see.

Part 4: Managing Up

Your boss is not your friend nor your enemy. Your boss is a tired, stressed out middle manager who is terrified of their boss and getting [laid off themselves in this job market.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/middle-managers-are-getting-laid-offbut-their-role-is-more-important-than-ever-says-leadership-expert.html)

Most employees try to impress their boss by bringing them “good ideas.” “Hey, we should start a culture committee!” “Hey, we should try this new software!”

Often times to your boss, a “good idea” looks like more work which is the last thing he wants to do.

To succeed, you need to stop find ways to make your boss’ life easier. What are his/her pain points, and how can you alleviate them?

Identify the one thing that stresses your boss out the most.

- Is it the weekly report to the VP?

- The budget & headcount planning ?

- A specific project deadline?

- A specific client churn?

Take that problem away from them and handle it. If you make your boss’s life easier, they will protect you. They will always advocate for you because you make them look good and they need you to be successful at their own job.

This is how you secure your position in the hierarchy by becoming the person who holds the keys to your manager’s peace of mind.

Part 5: Visibility

There is a myth that “good work speaks for itself.” In a remote or hybrid corporate world, this is extremely hard to do. Unless you’re a top 5-10% performer (and that’s being generous), that phrase probably doesn’t work for you.

Think of this like grade school. Who was always the teacher’s pet that got special treatment? The kid asking questions and engaged in the lesson? Or the kid sitting in the back corner all to himself.

If you solve a crisis at 8:00 PM on a Friday and nobody knows about it, you didn’t solve a crisis, you just lost your Friday night.

You must create visibility.

The anonymous IT Director admitted to writing emails at 3 PM and scheduling them to send at 8:47 PM. Why? Because an email sent at 3 PM looks like “doing your job.” An email sent at 8:47 PM looks like “dedication.”

People do this all the time in my industry to give the perception “they’re always online”.

Do not attend meetings just to “listen in.” If you are in a meeting, do your best to speak up with something of value. If you have nothing to add to the content, ask a strategic question.

By speaking, you’re showing your presence and that you’re engaged.

Part 6: The Mentor vs. The Sponsor (Knowing the Difference)

You need both a mentor (to show you the ropes), but also a sponsor (to help advocate for you and open doors).

You cannot navigate the corporate matrix alone. You need guides and you need advocates.

A mentor shows you the ropes. They have done your job before successfully and can help fast track the learning curve and success. They can help you navigate a tricky situation and help with personal growth.

Look for someone 1-2 levels above you whose work you admire, or someone in a spot where you want to be down the road. I wrote more on how to find and attract them [here](https://randomrecruiter.substack.com/p/mailbag-stop-asking-for-mentors-and).

A sponsor doesn't teach you how to do the job. A sponsor uses their influence to help you move up the ladder. A sponsor is the person in the closed door meetings who pounds the table and says, "Joe is ready for X promotion/project. I’m willing to bet my reputation on it."

You cannot ask someone to be your sponsor, you have to earn it. It comes naturally. Sponsors are senior leaders who need high performers to execute their vision. You earn sponsorship by consistently delivering high impact work that make them look good. I wrote more about this [here](https://randomrecruiter.substack.com/p/the-advantage-of-finding-a-sponsor?utm_source=publication-search).

Mentors talk to you. Sponsors talk about you when you aren't in the room.

You need both. But do not confuse them. A mentor will help you be good at your current job. A sponsor will pull you up to the next one.

Part 7: Networking Internally

I talk about this often and I believe it’s one of the most important things you can do in your career.

There is the official Org Chart (what shows up on the company intranet portal), and there is the “Get Sh*t Done Org Chart (how things actually get done).

The official chart tells you who reports to whom. The Shadow Chart tells you who actually has influence.

Most employees make the mistake of only talking to their immediate team. Your immediate team are your competitors for the one promotion slot available. This only limits you and your internal network when you need to make allies.

You need to build alliances with the people who control the resources and the narrative.

1. The decision to promote you is rarely made by your boss alone. It is made in a calibrated room full of other people. If your boss says, “I want to promote Joe,” and the Sales Director says “Who?”, you’re beat. But if the Sales Director says, “Oh yeah, Joe helped us crush that project, he’s solid,” you give yourself a pretty good shot.

You need advocates in rooms you are not invited to. For example, I make friends with people in compliance to push things along in our back office. I write up an offer to a client? I ping someone there and they push it within minutes, not hours.

I make friends with people in finance. Question on commission statement or need an expense report approved? I ping them directly.

I make friends on other teams. I have a candidate who fits their client but don’t know their process? I ping them for some info to help get him sent through.

2. The “Mafia” Effect (i.e PayPal Mafia)

Here is the long game that nobody plays: Your coworker today is your Hiring Manager tomorrow.

Competent people do not stay at stagnant companies. They go to better firms, get better jobs, and get bigger budgets to operate with. And the first thing they do when they land is look for people they trust to bring with them.

This is the “PayPal Mafia” effect on a micro scale.

I have seen entire careers built on following one high performer from company to company.

- They move to Company A -> They hire you (20% raise).

- They move to Company B -> They hire you (20% raise).

If you are a ghost internally, nobody remembers you when they leave. If you are the “go to” person who gets sh*t done, you are the first text message they send when they get their new headcount.

When I got laid off, this is literally how I got most of my offers. I took some time off, and all I had to do was make a handful of phone calls. I didn’t have to deal with any job applications or internal recruiters. Just people vouching for me to their bosses.

Network internally not just to survive your current job, but to pre book your ticket to your next one. This is literally the #1 takeaway you should get from this article.

Part 8: The Loyalty Tax

This is the hardest pill for people to swallow.

Loyalty to a corporation is a tax on your lifetime earnings.

I was literally the #1 performer for 10 years. I played the game perfectly. And when the math changed and my company decided to scrape my entire division, I was let go (along with approx 40 people, some of them there longer than me).

Luckily I worked off commission to “dial myself a raise” as my boss called it, so staying at the same place for so long was a benefit for my income. Most of you reading this can’t say the same.

The average internal raise is 3%. Maybe 5% if you’re a “rockstar” but regardless that certainly won’t be the norm. The average external raise when switching jobs is 10-20%.

If you stay at the same company for 10 years out of “loyalty,” you are losing out on a ton of money in your career income.

Think like a mercenary and not a “family member”. You are part of a business of one selling services to a client.

- Your employer is your client.

- Your salary is your retainer.

A consultant doesn’t get offended when a contract ends. They just go find a new client. You gotta treat your career the same way.

Always be interviewing. I take recruiter calls even when I’m happy. At least 1x/quarter I interview with a competitor. The ones I like, I keep in touch with. When I got laid off, 2 of them gave me a job offer when I reached back out.

If you don’t know what you are worth on the open market, you are negotiating blind. The person who is willing to walk away always holds the leverage. If you need the job more than they need you, you have already lost.

Part 9: The “Budget” Theater

In my years in staffing, I’ve learned that budgets are “use it or lose it.”

If you’re a manager and you save the company money by being frugal, you don’t get a medal. You get your budget cut next year. Just like our government, the system is designed to penalizes savers.

Smart corporate operators understand what my old boss described as Budget Theater. They fight for resources, spend their budget, and ask for more headcount. Why? Because the size of your budget and the size of your team is a proxy for your importance in the organization.

A manager with a $50k budget and 1 direct report is easy to lay off. A manager with a $2M budget and 15 direct reports is a “strategic leader.”

TL;DR

I didn’t get to the top 1% by following the rules in the employee handbook. I got there with street smarts, nuance, and reading between the lines.

1. Kill the Meritocracy Mindset: You’re paid for perception, not just performance.

2. Speak with impact: Translate your work into revenue, risk, and costs.

3. Be Strategically Incompetent: Avoid low value work so you can focus on high impact stuff.

4. Network Internally: This will either help you get promoted internally or open doors elsewhere.

5. Visibility: If you don’t broadcast your wins, they didn’t happen.

6. Mercenary Mindset: Treat your desk as a business.

I played this game and built myself a path to escape the rat race by ~40 years old.

When I got laid off, it had zero effect on my personal life or my path to FI because I'm someone who recognized “how to play the game” and acted early.
